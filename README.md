# Introduction
Task Manager app created with Bash Shell Scripting. You can easily add new tasks with title, description, due date and number of days you want the task to be executed. A scheduler runs in the background, checks the due date of each task and deletes all expired tasks. The manager uses a simple PowerShell script to send a reminder to the user.
